# Scala Game

Star Wars Game for Scala Term Project.

Made with Scage game engine which can be found here: https://github.com/dunnololda/scage

Use Maven to build the game, as SBT plugin seems to have errors.

For example, go to the main directory(with pom.xml file) and type:

>> mvn package

The engine generates a script which will run the game for you.
On Linux it can be found in target/game-1.0-linux.dir after you have built the game.
Go to this directory and just write:

>> bash run.sh

to start the game. Have fun! :)
